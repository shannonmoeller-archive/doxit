Notes for myself while pulling together the remaining lose ends in MultiMarkdown standalone for Mac.

CURRENT:

?

HISTORY:

- Fix short options parsing in markdown.c

- Performance tests - compare with a very large markdown file vs. e.g. multimarkdown based on GLib.
	- Performance now seems approximately on par with the GLib version for massive files
- Garbage output e.g. when processing unicode within tags: <p>‚Üê</p>
	- This went away with removal of NSString from the GString printf-append function.
