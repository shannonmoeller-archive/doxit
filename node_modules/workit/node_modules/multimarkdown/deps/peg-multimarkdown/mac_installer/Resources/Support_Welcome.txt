Title:	Installer Welcome Message

This custom installer will install the **MultiMarkdown** directory into
`~/Library/Application Support/MultiMarkdown`. This directory contains a few
utility scripts and XSLT files that enable use of MultiMarkdown with
[Scrivener] and adds some additional features when using the [TextMate][]
[bundle].

**NOTE**: This package will overwrite certain files if you have previously
installed MultiMarkdown 2.0 in your `Application Support` folder. It will
leave most of the files untouched, but will overwrite some of the core XSLT
files and the core convenience scripts in `/bin`. You may wish to back that
folder up just in case (or better yet, move it to another location and start
fresh)

This package does **not** include the actual MultiMarkdown binary --- that
requires a separate installer.

For more information, please check out the MultiMarkdown [web
site](http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/).

You will be guided through the steps necessary to install this software.
